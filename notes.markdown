### Feedback and self-assessment <br> in undergraduate student seminars in mathematics

    <summary>Abstract</summary>
    In this article we will discuss bachelorâ€™s seminars in mathematics at ETH. Most students (in 
these  seminars)  are  neither  used  to  individually  preparing  material  from  textbooks  nor  to discussing advances mathematics with fellow students. 
As these seminars usually follow a single thread, it is often impossible to quickly catch up on 
the content of past lectures. Hence there is also the risk that students only focus on their own 
talks, which often results in badly aligned talks.
To overcome these problems, we 
implemented two tweaks to the standard setup. These are 
extensive  meetings  with  the  organizers  and  few  mandatory  exercises.
We  will  evaluate  the success  of  these  measures  and,  where  success  is  scarce,  propose  further  measures  to possibly address these problems.

<h3>Analysis I/II</h3>
<p>with <a href="https://people.math.ethz.ch/~einsiedl/">Manfred Einsiedler</a>. A (most likely) outdated complete version is available <a href="lecture_notes/Analysis-Skript.pdf">here</a>, 
the updated work-in-progress is <a href="https://people.math.ethz.ch/~einsiedl/Analysis-Skript.pdf">here</a>.</p>

These are extensive lecture notes in German for the first year course in analysis at ETH Zurich. 
They were in particular used in the academic years 2016-2017 (see <a href="https://metaphor.ethz.ch/x/2017/fs/401-1262-07L/">this</a> link) and 2017-2018 (see <a href="https://metaphor.ethz.ch/x/2017/hs/401-1261-07L/">this</a> and <a href="https://metaphor.ethz.ch/x/2018/fs/401-1262-07L/">this</a> link)
and will be used in the next academic year 2021-2022 (see <a href="https://metaphor.ethz.ch/x/2021/hs/401-1261-07L/">this</a> link).
The topics covered are roughly the following:
<ul>
<li>
Introduction to logic and set theory.
</li>
<li>
Real numbers, continuity.
</li>
<li>
Riemann integral for functions in one variable.
</li>
<li>
Sequences, convergence, series, power series.
</li>
<li>
Differential calculus for functions in one variable, the fundamental theorem of calculus.
</li>
<li>
Metric spaces.
</li>
<li>
Differential calculus for functions in several variables.
</li>
<li>
Implicit function theorem, inverse function theorem and an introduction to differential geometry (submanifolds of $\mathbb{R}^n$ and Lagrange multipliers).
</li>
<li>
Riemann integral for functions in several variables.
</li>
<li>
Path and surface integrals, Gauss' Theorem and Stokes' Theorem.
</li>
<li>
Ordinary differential equations.
</li>
</ul>

<h3>
What is... the shape of a lattice?
</h3>

<a href="lecture_notes/what_is.pdf">These</a> are colloquial notes for a talk I gave in the 
<a href="https://www.math.uzh.ch/index.php?id=ve_KO_det&key2=1187&semId=38">"What is...?"-seminar</a> of the Zurich Graduate School of Mathematics.

<h3>On the "Banana"-Trick of Margulis</h3>

Short and very preliminary <a href="lecture_notes/banana.pdf">notes</a> explaining the thickening trick developed by G.A. Margulis in a specific instance. These were used in the seminar "Homogeneous Dynamics and Counting Problems" mentioned elsewhere.

<h3>Arithmeticity of lattices in higher rank real groups</h3>

Preliminary <a href="lecture_notes/ArithmeticityMargulis.pdf">notes</a> for a talk I gave in an informal reading course in Zurich, fall 2019. 
The aim of these notes is to deduce arithmeticity of lattices in higher-rank real groups from Margulis' superrigidity result.
