 </a>. 2023, arXiv:2311.17746.
<details style="color:gray">
    <summary>Abstract</summary>
We use composition of binary quadratic forms to systematically create pairs of Seifert surfaces that are non-isotopic in the four-ball. Our main result employs Gauss composition to classify the pairs of binary quadratic forms that arise as the Seifert forms of pairs of disjoint Seifert surfaces of genus one. The main ingredient of the proof is number theoretic and of independent interest. It establishes a new connection between the Bhargava cube and the geometric approach to Gauss composition via planes in the space of two-by-two matrices.

 </a>. 2023, arXiv:2301.10671.
<details style="color:gray">
    <summary>Abstract</summary>
    Let $\{a_t:tâˆˆ\R\}<SL_d(\R)$ be a diagonalizable subgroup whose expanding horospherical subgroup $U<SL_d(\R)$ is abelian. By the Birkhoff ergodic theorem, for any $x\in \SL_d(\R)/SL_d(\Z)$ and for almost every point $u\in U$ the point $ux$ is Birkhoff generic for $a_t$ when $t\to \infty$. We prove that the same is true when $U$ is replaced by any non-degenerate analytic curve in $U$.
This Birkhoff genericity result has various applications in Diophantine approximation. For instance, we obtain density estimates for Dirichlet improvability along typical points on a curve in Euclidean space. Other applications address approximations by algebraic numbers and best approximations (in the sense of Lagarias).

<details style="color:gray">
    <summary>Abstract</summary>
    We prove a version of Linnik's basic lemma uniformly over the base field using theta-series and geometric invariant theory in the spirit of Khayutin's approach (Duke Math. J., 168(12), 2019). As an application, we establish entropy bounds for limits of invariant measures on homogeneous toral sets in GL(4) of biquadratic, cyclic, or dihedral type.

    <summary>Abstract</summary>
    To any $k$-dimensional subspace of $\mathbb{Q}^n$ one can naturally associate a point in the Grassmannian $\mathrm{Gr}_{n,k}(\mathbb{R})$ and two shapes of lattices of rank $k$ and $n-k$ respectively. 
    These lattices originate by intersecting the $k$-dimensional subspace with the lattice $\mathbb{Z}^n$. Using unipotent dynamics we prove simultaneous equidistribution of all of these objects under a congruence conditions when $(k,n)\neq (2,4)$.

Simultaneous supersingular reductions of CM elliptic curves </a>.  J. Reine Angew. Math. 786 (2022), 1-43.
	<details style="color:gray">
    <summary>Abstract</summary>
 We study the simultaneous reductions at several supersingular primes of elliptic curves with complex multiplication. 
 We show - under additional congruence assumptions on the CM order - that the reductions are surjective (and even become equidistributed) on the product of supersingular loci when the discriminant of the order becomes large. 
 This variant of the equidistribution theorems of Duke and Cornut-Vatsal is an(other) application of the recent work of Einsiedler and Lindenstrauss on the classification of joinings of higher-rank diagonalizable actions.

Duke Math. J. 171 (2022), no. 7, 1469-1529.
	<details style="color:gray">
    <summary>Abstract</summary>
To any two-dimensional rational plane in four-dimensional space one can naturally attach a point in the Grassmannian $\operatorname{Gr}(2,4)$ and four lattices of rank two.
Here, the first two lattices originate from the plane and its orthogonal complement and the second two essentially arise from the accidental local isomorphism between $\operatorname{SO}(4)$ and $\operatorname{SO}(3)\times \operatorname{SO}(3)$. 
As an application of a recent result of Einsiedler and Lindenstrauss on algebraicity of joinings we prove simultaneous equidistribution of all of these objects under two splitting conditions.

	<details style="color:gray">
    <summary>Abstract</summary>
We use maximal entropy methods to examine the distribution properties of primitive integer points on spheres and of CM points on the modular surface. 
The proofs we give are a modern and dynamical interpretation of Linnik's original ideas and follow techniques presented by Einsiedler, Lindenstrauss, Michel and Venkatesh in 2011.
