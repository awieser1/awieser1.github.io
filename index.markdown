title: About me
---

I am currently a postdoc under the guidance of <a href="http://www.ma.huji.ac.il/~elon/">Elon Lindenstrauss</a> at the Einstein Institute of Mathematics.
Before that, I was a PhD student with <a href="https://people.math.ethz.ch/~menashea/">Menny Aka</a> and <a href="https://people.math.ethz.ch/~einsiedl/">Manfred Einsiedler</a> at ETH Zurich.
My research concerns homogeneous dynamics.
I am particularly interested in equidistribution problems coming from number theory.

#Linnik-type problems are particularly popular instance of this and encompass, among other things, variants of Duke's theorem for CM points or closed geodesics on the modular curve.
#Closed orbits of semisimple groups often also encode number-theoretic results
