title: About me
---

I am currently visiting the University of California at San Diego and the IAS in Princeton with a <a href="https://data.snf.ch/grants/grant/217944">Postdoc.Mobility</a> grant of the Swiss National Science Foundation. 
Before that, I had the pleasure of being a postdoc at the Einstein Institute of Mathematics in Jerusalem under the guidance of <a href="http://www.ma.huji.ac.il/~elon/">Elon Lindenstrauss</a>.
In 2021, I finished my PhD with <a href="https://people.math.ethz.ch/~menashea/">Menny Aka</a> and <a href="https://people.math.ethz.ch/~einsiedl/">Manfred Einsiedler</a> at ETH Zurich.

My research concerns homogeneous dynamics.
I am particularly interested in equidistribution problems coming from number theory.
