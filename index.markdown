# About me

I am currently a postdoc under the guidance of <a href="http://www.ma.huji.ac.il/~elon/">Elon Lindenstrauss</a>	and Shahar Mozes at the Einstein Institute of Mathematics.
Before that, I was a PhD student with <a href="https://people.math.ethz.ch/~menashea/">Menny Aka</a> and <a href="https://people.math.ethz.ch/~einsiedl/">Manfred Einsiedler</a> at ETH Zurich.
My research concerns homogeneous dynamics and its application to problems in number theory.
See for example <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejUHAPYKRGU">this talk</a> I gave at <a href="https://www.icts.res.in/program/etds2019">ICTS</a> in Bangalore.

From January to March 2020 I was a visitor at the Hausdorff research institute in Bonn for the trimester program <a href="https://www.him.uni-bonn.de/programs/future-programs/future-trimester-programs/dynamics-topology-and-numbers/description/">"Dynamics: Topology and Numbers"</a>.
From October 2020 to April 2021 I was visiting Ilya Khayutin at Northwestern University thanks to <a href="http://p3.snf.ch/Project-195737">this</a> SNSF mobility fellowship.
