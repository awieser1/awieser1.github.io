# Teaching

## 2020

I am not teaching this year.

## Previous activities

During the academic year 2018-2019 <a>Jennifer-Jayne Jakob</a> and I organized the graduate seminar "What's so cool about..?" where professors give talks explaining what's "cool" their research. See <a href="https://math.ethz.ch/news-and-events/events/research-seminars/whats-so-cool-about.html?s=hs18">this</a> link for the speakers in the spring semester.

Here is a selection of other teaching activities of mine (see my <a href="https://people.math.ethz.ch/~awieser/other/cv_AW.pdf">CV</a> for a more complete list):

- Teaching assistant for commutative algebra taught by <a href="https://people.math.ethz.ch/~kowalski/">Emmanuel Kowalski</a>.
- Teaching assistant for a seminar taught by <a href="https://people.math.ethz.ch/~einsiedl/">Manfred Einsiedler</a>. Note that this is a continuation of the course <a href="https://metaphor.ethz.ch/x/2019/fs/401-3462-00L/">Functional analysis II</a> in Spring 2019.
- Spring 2019: I organized the <a href="https://metaphor.ethz.ch/x/2019/fs/401-3110-19L/">seminar</a> "Primes of the form $x^2+ny^2$" with <a href="https://people.math.ethz.ch/~menashea/">Menny Aka</a> and <a href="https://manuelluethi.github.io/">Manuel Luethi</a> that roughly treated the first half of D.A. Cox' book with the same title.
- Fall 2018 and Spring 2019: teaching assistant for <a href="https://metaphor.ethz.ch/x/2018/hs/401-3461-00L/">Functional analysis I</a> and <a href="https://metaphor.ethz.ch/x/2019/fs/401-3462-00L/">Functional analysis II</a> by <a href="https://people.math.ethz.ch/~einsiedl/">Manfred Einsiedler</a> writing exercise sheets and solutions.
- Spring 2018: I organized the <a href="https://metaphor.ethz.ch/x/2018/fs/401-3370-67L/">seminar</a> "Homogeneous Dynamics and Counting Problems" with <a href="https://people.math.ethz.ch/~einsiedl/">Manfred Einsiedler</a> and <a href="https://manuelluethi.github.io/">Manuel Luethi</a>.
- Spring 2017: I organized the <a href="https://metaphor.ethz.ch/x/2017/fs/401-3370-17L/">seminar</a> "Arithmetic of Quadratic Forms" with <a href="https://people.math.ethz.ch/~menashea/">Menny Aka</a> following the book of Cassels with the same title.

## Lecture notes and other writings

<a href="https://learningteaching.ethz.ch/index.php/lt-eth/article/view/77/38"><b> Feedback and self
-assessment in undergraduate student 
seminars in mathematics  </b></a> with Manuel Luethi, ETH Learning and Teaching Journal, Vol 2, No 1, 2020.

Abstract: " In this article we will discuss bachelorâ€™s seminars in mathematics at ETH. Most students (in 
these  seminars)  are  neither  used  to  individually  preparing  material  from  textbooks  nor  to discussing advances mathematics with fellow students. 
As these seminars usually follow a single thread, it is often impossible to quickly catch up on 
the content of past lectures. Hence there is also the risk that students only focus on their own 
talks, which often results in badly aligned talks.
To overcome these problems, we 
implemented two tweaks to the standard setup. These are 
extensive  meetings  with  the  organizers  and  few  mandatory  exercises.  We  will  evaluate  the success  of  these  measures  and,  where  success  is  scarce,  propose  further  measures  to possibly address these problems."


<a href="lecture_notes/Analysis-Skript.pdf"><b> Analysis I/II </b></a>

These are extensive lecture notes in german written by <a href="https://people.math.ethz.ch/~einsiedl/">Manfred Einsiedler</a> and myself (with additions by Peter Jossen) for the first year course in analysis at ETH Zurich. 
They were in particular used in the academic years 2016-2017 (see <a href="https://metaphor.ethz.ch/x/2017/fs/401-1262-07L/">this</a> link) and 2017-2018 (see <a href="https://metaphor.ethz.ch/x/2017/hs/401-1261-07L/">this</a> and <a href="https://metaphor.ethz.ch/x/2018/fs/401-1262-07L/">this</a> link).
The topics covered are roughly the following:
- Introduction to logic and set theory.
- Real numbers, continuity.
- Riemann integral for functions in one variable.
- Sequences, convergence, series, power series.
- Differential calculus for functions in one variable, the fundamental theorem of calculus.
- Metric spaces.
- Differential calculus for functions in several variables.
- Implicit function theorem, inverse function theorem and an introduction to differential geometry (submanifolds of $\mathbb{R}^n$ and Lagrange multipliers).
- Riemann integral for functions in several variables.
- Path and surface integrals, Gauss' Theorem and Stokes' Theorem.
- Ordinary differential equations.

<a href="lecture_notes/what_is.pdf"><b> What is... the shape of a lattice?</b></a>

These are colloquial notes for a talk I give in the <a href="https://www.math.uzh.ch/index.php?id=ve_KO_det&key2=1187&semId=38">"What is...?"-seminar</a> of the Zurich Graduate School of Mathematics.

<a href="lecture_notes/banana.pdf"><b> On the "Banana"-Trick of Margulis </b></a>

Short and very preliminary notes explaining the thickening trick developed by G.A. Margulis in a specific instance. These were used in the seminar "Homogeneous Dynamics and Counting Problems" mentioned above.

<a href="lecture_notes/ArithmeticityMargulis.pdf"><b> Arithmeticity of lattices in higher rank real groups </b></a>

Preliminary notes for a talk I gave in an informal reading course in Zurich, fall 2019. The aim of these notes is to deduce arithmeticity of lattices in higher-rank real groups from Margulis' superrigidity result.
